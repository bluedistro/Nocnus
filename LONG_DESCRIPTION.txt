Nocnus is a simple Python library built on top of Pymongo to ensemble the basic MongoDB CRUD operations into one class in order to simplify its usage and save some development time.

Why the name Nocnus?
Ocnus is the name of the greek god of delays and frustrations and we
do not want any any of those in implementing basic CRUD MongoDB operations
thus the name. (No Ocnus => Nocnus)
